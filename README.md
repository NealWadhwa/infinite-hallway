## How It Works

Each frame is generated by stable diffusion. Then, [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) is used to estimate the depth of the frame. This gives us a point cloud, which can be used to move the camera to a new location. Previously occluded or unseen regions are inpainted using stable diffusion allowing for the generation of an infinite hallway that has true parallax.
